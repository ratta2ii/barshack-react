### **Description**

_This is a clinet side application built in React. The focus of this project was to practice drilling down props to lower level components, and to show a fundamental understanding of lifting state. The application uses a brewery site that allows a user from the outside to view a list of all products. There is also an option for an administrator that will present a user a page that will give the user the option to have more functionality. From here, the admin can add new beers to the producst list, or hit a button to order a single beer that will be subtracted from a keg that begins with 124 pints._

_Please note that this is a second week project so there are some improvments that can be made. Most notably using Redux to directly pass props from parent to child rather than taking the long path all the way down the component tree. The authoriztion in this application is also subpar, but I hope to address this is the recent future as we progress through this course._
